    <h2 class="text-2xl">How does this website help Ukrainian volunteers?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The main purpose of the website is to help volunteers get funds from all
      round the world for the needs of Ukrainians. Citizens of Ukraine suffer
      from fascist actions of the Russian army every day and have to fight for
      the country.

    <p class="mt-4">
      On the website you can fill out a simple registration. You need to specify
      what kind of activities you’re into and what you require financial help
      for. As soon as you pass the verification by our moderators, your profile
      will get available on the list on the main page.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      To get financial support you should specify your bank account details and
      your full name or create a link in the Monobank app. The bank account you
      specify will be used to transfer the funds to. All resources will be sent
      to you directly with no interaction with our website. No commission, no
      delay. In other words, we provide only information services.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl">How can you help volunteers in Ukraine?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      All profiles of volunteers are published on our website. Each profile
      includes information about kinds of activities which volunteers are
      involved in and the way in which you can provide help.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Each of them works hard helping Ukrainian hospitals, army, police, people
      who lost their home, refugees, children who left without parents. Any
      contribution can save the lives of Ukrainians.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Our website provides informational services about volunteer’s activities.
      We are not responsible for their work. But we substantially check every
      volunteer before publishing their profile. We recommend volunteers to add
      links to their social network accounts, where they present the work
      they’ve done.

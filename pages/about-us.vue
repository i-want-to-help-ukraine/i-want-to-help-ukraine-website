      We are a team of developers from Ukraine and Poland, who desire to help to
      fight against the injustice that the Ukrainian people have faced.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Our mission is to connect volunteers and those who are willing to help
      them in the fight for peace in Ukraine. We believe that the published
      information will make the work of volunteering easier.

      Dozens and dozens of innocent people die in Ukraine, in the center of
      Europe, every day.

      Now it is extremely important for the world to unite and defend
      fundamental human values.

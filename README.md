# I Want To Help Ukraine

This project is an informational platform, a social initiative, powered by the group of volunteer engineers from Ukraine and Moldova.

Our main goal is **to connect Ukrainian volunteer fundraisers with people all over the world who are willing to donate**.

The initial version of the website allows the volunteer to register and request financial support for Ukrainian army or/and Ukrainians in need. Subsequently, after passing the verification from our admins, the volunteer appears on the list on the main page. All people who are interested in donating will get opportunity to find the volunteers on our website, using filter by _city_ and _tags_ (categories of supplies the volunteer wants to purchase with fundraised money).

Volunteer's info includes:

1. the name
1. the city
1. short description of their activity
1. links to social media
1. description of the ways the funds may be transferred

Let's say, I want to donate Ukrainian army for bulletproof vests, being abroad. All I need to do is to find a person who requires money for purchasing this kind of supplies, using the platform. I will get the info how I can do it and the links to social media (Facebook, Instagram) where I can monitor the volunteer's activity.

Our mission is **to support Ukraine in this terrifying situation and help other do it**.

## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).

### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/store).
